My name is Jordan O'Connor and I'm an engineer.
Graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology.

I am Working for [Corning][corning].
I mostly develop applications for test benches, but
occasionally I get creative on the web.

### What's This All About?

Keeping a daily blog is one of the things that helps
me stay on track as I tackle my plans and goals.

I talk about work, family, finances, and whatever is going on
at the moment in my head.
