I really think that all of the pieces need to be in place for me to be successful everyday.<br /><br />There needs to be a balance, things that keep other things in check so that I don't get off track. For example, my exercise is what helps me keep focus during the day and sleep well at night.<br /><br />Eating healthy will allow me to stay healthy and keep off the weight that I can gain really easily.<br /><br />Those two things combined will help me maintain a physical balance that will lead to success.<br /><br />Reading my Bible will help me stay focused on what is most important in life and keep me spiritually grounded.<br /><br />Planning my days will allow me to think less about what I should be doing and do more of what I plan on doing.<br /><br />Loving my wife and spending time with her daily allows me to remain emotionally stable and keep me light.<br /><br />There are little things that happen every day that lead to a successful life, and that's what I am aiming for.<br /><br />Jordan
