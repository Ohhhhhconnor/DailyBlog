description: Every morning is a chance to do things right

We moved into our new apartment today, and it's a really good change.

It's not a massive change, not too much larger or any more special, but it is a much more inspiring and creative environment. Our last apartment was half underground, had hardly any windows, and didn't have the greatest layout.

>Should I let something like an apartment affect me? Probably not. But, when you are at your weakest moments, you never know what subconscious things are going to help pull you through.
----------
I really would like to start a freelance web design business, but I have no experience in design. I have a good base for backend and frontend coding, but creating custom designs for clients is not my forte.

I think I want to ask my cousin Shawn about potentially collaborating with me on some projects. He's an incredible designer and would really allow me to offer a complete package to many different types of clients.
----------
Tomorrow morning I will get up early as I have been for the past several weeks. I get up at 5 AM and work on the most important thing for that day. Sometimes it's for the [church website][church], sometimes [my own][mine], sometimes [Hannah's][hannah], sometimes it's used to increase my own learning in web development.

I also want to make sure I am using my morning time as time to spend praying and talking with God. I'd like to be in his word and praying for at least a half hour every morning. I think that will be important to my success in the future. My visions need to line up with what God has for me.

Tomorrow isn't exactly anything special, but it's a new start, just like every morning. Here's to tomorrow.
