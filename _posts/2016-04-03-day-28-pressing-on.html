I've been at this for several weeks, and it feels good.<br /><br />Right about now is when I really need to hunker down and continue the race. It's easy for me to stagnate a bit and lose my focus. I think this blog is helping me with that. <br /><br />I have been able to get my ideas out of my head and somewhere where I can look back at them. Could I be writing it in a journal? Sure, but that's something I just couldn't get in a habit of doing.<br /><br />Blogging "publicly" has allowed me to be more transparent, all while holding me more accountable. I can't just not do the things I will say I need to do.<br /><br />I'm prepared to work harder this week at work than any other week before, because work now has a purpose in my plan. In the past few months, it didn't fit into my plan. I thought I needed to start a business today and drop everything.<br /><br />Now I know I can't do that. Because of that, working "for the man" is a huge part of my plan to get out of debt and prosper. Not only that, but higher education is on the table as well. <br /><br />If I can go back to school for two years and get a masters degree, I could make more at Corning and even further accelerate my debt payoff.<br /><br />But, working full time, going to grad school, freelancing on the side, having a baby and managing to spend any time doing anything else outside of that would be crazy. I'm into it, though.<br /><br />Right now is a time in my life when I need to hustle. I need to be working harder than I ever have and ever will in the future. I have life in my bones, and time on my hands. It's about time I used it to my advantage. <br /><br />Getting serious about my debt payoff and generating a winning attitude are very important things to me. I want my family to be very successful and I think we have a lot to show the world. <br /><br />I really want to include Hannah into my success story because she has so much to offer. I think that she has so much potential to make a huge impact on the world. I want to support her as much as I possibly can. <br /><br /><div>I also want to make sure I am on the same page with her in regards to our debt payoff. We both need to be tackling it hardcore if we want to get this thing out of the way. I know I am ready for it.<br /><br />This blog has helped me a lot. I need to continue to do the things I say I will do.<br /><br />Jordan</div>
