Today is the last day before I start a week long fast of both food and digital entertainment/social media. It's extreme, but I think it will be awesome.<br /><br />I'm ready for a good reset. I haven't done a week long fast in a few years. I remember the profound impact it had on me back then.<br /><br />I plan on fasting more often. I think it is good to keep thing fresh and have a clean slate to work with. Coupled with being in the word and prayer time, it is truly the best way to spiritually align with the plan that God has for your life.<br /><br />Having an entertainment/social media fast will impact me both at work and at home. At work, when things are slow, I default to going on YouTube and read articles about anything and everything.<br /><br />It's not necessarily bad entertainment, but the default behavior is unacceptable in my eyes and my work ethic suffers for it. I feel that I need to show the people I work with that I can do above and beyond the things that they ask me to do.<br /><br />Part of the time I gain while fasting I would like to use for reading and planning. I want to read my Bible more, and also plan on how to tackle some of the things I have mentioned in previous posts.<br /><br />I will continue posting throughout the fast. It'll help me document how I feel and what I think.<br /><br />This feels good.<br /><br />Jordan
