I can't always focus on the big picture, sometimes I just need to focus on the next step.<br /><br />That's Hannah's advice, anyways, and it makes sense. Last night after explaining some of my biggest ideas to friends I started to feel scared and intimidated by it all.<br /><br />I'm ambitious, I'm not just going to settle for something that isn't the best that I can do. But, even my visions are too big for me sometimes. That's when I just need to sit down and figure out what's next.<br /><br />What's next? Learning the tools I need to start building my platform. That's what I'm currently doing. I plan on having the platform done in 3-4 months (for launching, that is).<br /><br />I will need to spend a few months promoting, advertising and getting my platform out there before I start a KickStarter to fund some of the platform. During this time I will continue to refine the platform and develop phone / tablet applications.<br /><br />It is crazy to think that I will be doing this on my own. "Hey, my name is Jordan and I'm the CEO, lead developer and head marketer of XYZ." To see my vision come to fruition I will definitely need people.<br /><br />But, right now, I need to keep my head down and press forward. I'm in a learning phase, and I will be for a long time, even after launching.<br /><br />In other news, I'm super excited for our baby to come in to the world in August. I'm totally ready to take on that role and still continue to grow in every area of my life. I don't see it as a burden, but a reminder that I need to be more vigilant than ever.<br /><br />I want to be able to continue working just as hard when i have to get up in the middle of the night to care for the baby. I want to cherish those moments, not regret them.<br /><br />I'm excited about a lot of things now a days. Things are moving forward really fast and I enjoy growing everyday instead of remaining stagnate.<br /><br />Jordan
