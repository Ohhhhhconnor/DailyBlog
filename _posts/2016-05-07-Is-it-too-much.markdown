description: Is there a limit on my morning productivity?
---

I think that humans are incredible creatures, built with a lot more tenacity
than they think they have.

But is there a limit to how much I can do in the day? Sure, but I haven't hit
that yet. My goal is to get 6 hours of sleep regularly, and get up at 4 AM.
That means, sleep 10 PM to 4 AM.

Getting less sleep hasn't really effected me yet. When I wake up, I'm just as
tired as I would be if I woke up at 9 AM. Part of that is due to how I eat and
how I exercise. But knowing that I have put good hours into the things that are
important to me? That makes it so worth it.

At the end of the day I truly feel like I got things done. I can relax, give my
attention to Hannah and not worry about not living my dream. Part of my dream is
the work that I have to put into it, so when I am doing that, I am satisfied.

Getting up at 4 AM makes things more even in my mind. I can spend an hour on three things
before 7. And honestly, it only takes me a half hour to get ready in the mornings, so I could
spend 30 minutes on something else.

In order to do this, I will need to have prepared the night before. I will need to get all of
my clothes ready (for exercise and work), and I will need to plan out my hours so that I
don't waste them. As long as I do that, I think this getting up at 4 AM thing won't be so
bad.

I can get a lot done in 1 hour everyday. Because I'm not doing tasks all at once, I have time
to reflect and brew on choices before I make progress the next day. Between 1 hour weekdays
and 4 ~ 5 hours on Saturdays, I will be well on my way to completing my goals and being
successful.

All of the pieces to the puzzle need to be in place for me to be able to pull this off. I
need to be praying, exercising and eating healthy. The work part is easy for me, but the
other things require paying attention.

I feel like I'm in a really good spot. I'm growing everyday, and not staying stagnate like
I was before I started doing all of this.
