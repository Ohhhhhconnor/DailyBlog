description: Consistency will be important to my success in life
---

Lately I have been inconsistent with the things that I accomplish in the mornings.
It has been tough with the recent move, but I should still be doing everything that I need to do.

I need to work out, not because I want to run a half marathon in September, but it will
allow me to have more energy and be healthy. That's a necessary thing for me.

I really would like to be getting up at 4 every morning. There are three things
that have some of my highest priority ranking that I would like to do daily. I'd
like to spend 1 hour on all three.

I want to have dedicated praying/Bible time. I want to work out. I want to keep moving
forward with my learning and web development.

I want to have a consistent morning every morning. Something that is the same, so I
know what to expect. Right now, when I wake up, I don't really know what I will be
doing. I need to have a set timeline rather than making it up as I go.

I think I would like to start off with praying/reading. Then, working out. Then,
working on skill. Then, web development / business development. An example of a skill
could be something like speeding up my typing, or learning a new skill that I can use
often to make my life better (like cooking, catching up on math/physics, etc.).

This would allow me to fully embrace the evenings and allow me to unwind for the day
knowing that I have accomplished the things that I set out to do. In the evenings,
It would be all about spending time with my wife and eventually my family. I would
also like to set aside time to read in the evenings. At least a half hour.

I think doing this will allow me to be better as a person, it would allow me to be more
consistent in how I am and how I spend my time. Part of my consistency will also come
with how I plan my day the night before. I need to have a set plan of what I will accomplish
during the hours that I am spending on these things.

I am currently reading a book by 99U, and the basic emphasis is that much more can be accomplished
in your life if you spend smaller chunks on it everyday rather than doing it all in one shot.
Not only is it more consistent and productive, it also allows your mind to think about things
in between days when you are not working on it. I believe that, and want to practice it.

This is my goal. To be consistent. But, I also want to be disruptable. I want to be able to handle
the things that life throws at me gracefully. Something like, the baby getting up in the middle of
the night, or any other emergency that can happen that will change how I spend my time slightly.

How will I be able to be disrupted? Possibly by prioritizing. If I am healthy, I can rely less on
the amount of sleep I get, and rather get shorter but more quality sleep.

My next goal is to start waking up at 4am every morning. It sounds crazy typing that, seeing as
how a month ago I could hardly get out of bed to get to work on time. I guess it comes down to
how badly I want to affect things in my life, rather than have my life affect me. I want to be
the thing that drives my outcome. No one can take the time away from me that I want to spend
growing myself.

Wish me luck.
