So, yesterday I talked about what type of business that I would like to own. It's something I am good at, and passionate about.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Bu how do I actually do that? How do I start working on a business from scratch when I have a 40hr/week salary job? Is it feasible to start slowly and work towards something? Do I need to freelance some of my other time to cash-flow the business?</div><div><br /></div><div>These are some important questions, ones that I will need to figure out. I think that some of these questions will be addressed in my EntreLeadership book, and I am listening to a lot of content from Seth Godin on starting a business.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>But there is a big difference between knowing what to do and actually doing it. That's what makes businesses successful, or fail really quickly. It takes a tenacity and a gut that does the right thing, always.</div><div><br /></div><div>What I'm finding is that the relationships and trust you build into your brand is much more important than the product you produce. It's about the story, the love and passion that drives you and your business that gives you an edge.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It's also about monopoly, which would be very tough in the market I would like to get into. But, like Seth says, no one is forcing you to go into the market you choose. That is something I will need to think about.</div><div><br /></div><div>It seems daunting how much goes into starting a business, but I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't try.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>A few people in the past have tried to discourage me from starting a business. They say it's too hard, and that it consumes your life. I don't mind working hard and long, so long as the freedom of a path that I have chosen for myself is replaced with it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't think I can live this safely for the rest of my life. There is no challenge to it. It was way too easy to get where I am today. It wasn't the best path, but it was the safe path for sure.</div><div><br /></div><div>The safe path never really was for me. I'm on the path to success.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
