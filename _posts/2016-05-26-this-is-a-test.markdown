description: Testing out my IFTTT recipe
---

This post is mostly just a test of my IFTTT recipe to automatically post my
posts to medium when I write them.

I hope this works!

I will be getting back to regular daily blogging next week. I'm missing out on
some things that are making me feel unbalanced. Time to refocus.

It's easy for me to slip out of a balanced day, for some reason. I tend to think
that if I spend more time on something that I will be more productive with it.
That's not the case. I just end up wasting the extra time.

I need to keep a balance so that the things I do get the full attention they
deserve and not just wasted time associated with them.

Let's do this.

Jordan
