I'm reading Dave Ramsey's book called EntreLeadership, and I am using it to help refine my goals.<br /><br />Goals must be specific and measurable. They also must have a time limit.<br /><br />There are seven generic areas that we can improve in our lives, they are:<br /><ol><li>Career</li><li>Financial</li><li>Spiritual</li><li>Physical</li><li>Intellectual</li><li>Family</li><li>Social</li></ol><div><br /></div><div>Remarkably, my goals were pretty well spread across these areas. And, some of them actually had specificity to them. Let's review my goals:</div><ol><li>I'm going to run a half marathon on September 18th.</li><li>Make at least $1000 a month on top of my salary.</li><li>I'm going to read more.</li><li>I want to exponentially increase my work rate at my employment.</li><li>I want to continue to deepen my relationship with my wife, family, and friends.</li><li>Time management.</li></ol><div>Some of these are well planned, most are not.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Career</b>: I will increase my work rate by limiting distractions from social media / entertainment starting now. I also will build relationships with co-workers by taking scheduled breaks at 10:30 AM and 2:30 PM.</div><div><br /></div><div><div><b>Financial</b>: I will make at least $1000 a month on top of my salary building tools via web/app development by November 2016 (6 months).</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Spiritual</b>: I am going to read my Bible/meditate/pray for at least 30 minutes a day starting now into eternity.</div></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>Physical</b>: Run a half marathon on September 18th, 2016 at a pace of 8:30 min/mile. I have this planned out via MapMyRun.</div><div><b><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />Intellectual</b>: I will learn the skills I need to complete my financial goal. I will do this by taking online classes, reading books and finding internet solutions. I will dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to this task starting now.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Family</b>: I will practice giving undivided attention to my wife everyday starting now. I also will do the same for my kids when I have them. (Is this really a goal? I might need to come up with something better.)</div><div><br /></div><div><b>Social</b>: I will research time management by reading books and doing research so that I can schedule regular time to enjoy with my friends (and extended family). I would like to spend at least an hour at the beginning of the week on this task.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This is an awesome list. Having these written out explicitly will help me a lot in the long run. I need to put them in a place where I can be reminded of them regularly.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Some of these goals are quite easy, and some of them are hardly goals, but this is a big step for me in living my life intentionally.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I would like to have goals for myself in all of these categories at least every 6 months so that I can continually refine myself and be a bit more dynamic than having goals for a whole year.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Once I finish / am completing these goals, I think it would be smart to set some more long term goals for all of these categories. It would be nice to have long term goals and be able to break them down into bite sized chunks.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This is awesome!</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div></div><br /><div><br /></div>
