description: Do what you say you're going to do
---

Sometimes it's hard for me to live up to the outlandish promises that I make for
people. I'm not a people pleaser, I genuinely want to help people. But,
sometimes I say I will do things that are really hard to complete and I don't
understand that going into it.

I tend to make a lot more promises than I should. That's partly because I A:
have a hard time saying no, and B: like to do things myself to make sure they
are done right.

This often sets me back in a few ways. When I don't complete a task that I say
I will do, people are disappointed and don't trust me as much. But often times,
they feel bad because the task was crazy and they weren't sure how I was going
to get it done in the first place.

Either way, there is an element of trust that I lose when I don't do what I say
I am going to do, and that should change.

If I am going to work for myself, or lead a successful company, I can't do
everything. I need to delegate my tasks in a way that makes sense and allows me
to complete the work that is most important and necessary for me.

This doesn't mean I will stop doing crazy things. Rather, it's a reminder to
think twice about the promises I make so that I can always stick to my word.
When I can do that, my word becomes more valuable and people will believe what
I say.
