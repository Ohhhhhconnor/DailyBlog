description: The beginning of something that makes a difference
---

Today I kicked off my business, [Backbone Electronics][site] in Rochester, NY.

This is something that has been on my mind for a while now, and it's awesome to
see how it is all unfolding. I am hoping that I can get enough business to make
the financial goals that I have set for myself.

I also am hoping that this business venture will give me valuable knowledge
about the dos and don'ts of small business operation. Many people I have talked
to say that starting and running a business is way more valuable than going to
school to learn.

I'll begin by posting on craigslist, maybe responding to requests from people
searching for tech help. All in all, getting customers will be the hardest thing
for my business. I'll need to do some serious networking with local businesses
to get the clients that need services.

Now, I need to start tracking my time and balancing my time with other things in
my life. I need to be fit, healthy and communicate well with others. I can't
afford to spend every minute on this business.

This is an exciting time! I am really happy about where things are at, and I
want to continue to grow this way.

Jordan
