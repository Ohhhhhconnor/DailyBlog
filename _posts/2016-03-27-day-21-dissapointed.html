Open source software failed me today.<div><br /></div><div>It's not their fault. It's not like they are getting paid to develop the application. I can't expect anything from something that I didn't pay for.</div><div><br /></div><div>I feel like I would love to give back to the open source community if I felt that I had any relevant experience. Let me explain.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have no experience writing user-oriented applications. I have only ever written math/manufacturing applications. The type of applications that most open-source project involve are for a consumer.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I also don't have a lot of experience with writing graphics/processor intensive tasks. So something like a video processor or encoder is something I would have to learn a lot about before attempting.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It's 2 AM. I should sleep.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
