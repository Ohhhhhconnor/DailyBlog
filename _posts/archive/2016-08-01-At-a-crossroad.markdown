description: How can I make more money?
---

Literally. That's all I want to do with my web development venture.

I know that the work is out there. I see all the time in Rochester that small
businesses are getting new - albeit crappy - websites. Where do I look to see
where these businesses are asking for web developers?

I'm trying my best to keep a level head about it all, but going out and getting
clients isn't the easiest thing for me. I'm much better at just doing the work
once the client gives me a project.

But, that's what this whole venture is about. I am trying to buff up my business
skills. If I can't make a single sale for myself, how can I expect to start a
business that will grow and expand as far as I would like to?

I am patiently waiting out this time period. I have a feeling I will get to a
point one day when I will look back and be amazed that I didn't have any work
lined up. I'll be so swamped with work I'll need to hire people to keep up.

I am trying this thing called "Self Journal". It's helping me get organized with
my short-term goals. My short-term goals are these:

1. Get my First client
2. Make my First $1000
3. Make $1000 in a Month

This is all organized to take place in the next three months. Hopefully it takes
less time than that, but that's what my goal is. I know that I will need to work
really hard to get to that point.

There are some things that I need to get out of the way before I can start to
build this web development dream of mine. I need to finish the River Rochester
website, since it isn't making me any money (though it is good practice). I also
need to get working on some templates that I can use to show off some of my
skills as a web developer.

I can certainly hold-weight with most in my skills, but my experience is weak.
I'll need to do the templates and maybe a few more free projects to get moving
in the direction that I want to go. That means I need to get all of that done
this month.

This morning went okay, I somewhat stuck to the plan. I kinda don't like taking
a shower directly after working out because I continue to sweat for a while even
after the shower. I almost think I should reserve getting ready in the morning
for a slightly later time so that I can cool off before I shower.

Staying motivated! Hannah helps me with that. She is tough on me and I
appreciate it. Hopefully I can live up to my potential and start to bring in
some income.
