I'm having a baby boy, folks!<br /><br />Today my wife and I had the 20 week ultrasounds to check the vitals of our baby and determine the gender. Let's just say it was quite obvious.<br /><br />It's crazy to think that I will be fathering a son soon. I can't wait. By that time I will be more productive than ever, because I will need to be.<br /><br />I will need to be sacrificially ready and available for my family, so I can't afford to slack off. I want to be running my future company by that time, and eventually I would like to get to the point where I can spend time with them and work as well.<br /><br />To me, I think working is a very important aspect of life. I think that my kids should be a part of that journey. I think they should know how working hard is good for them, and that they too should work hard for the life they want to live.<br /><br />I want to father my kids under the impression that they truly can be anything they want to be in the world. I want to show them that they can make their own path, and that the people they surround themselves with will impact them the most.<br /><br />But I also want my kids to be creating and making, not consuming constantly. I want them to get their hands dirty, use their brains, and be inspired to grow everyday.<br /><br />I want to have an awesome legacy to pass on to my kids, so that they can carry the torch and change the world.<br /><br />I want to change the world.<br /><br />Jordan
