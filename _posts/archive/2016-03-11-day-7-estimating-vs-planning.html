<h2>Estimating</h2><h3>To my demise</h3><br />I used to pride myself in the ability to estimate just about anything, even without a lot of prior knowledge in a subject. I can gauge a lot by how a question is asked, phrased and emphasized.<br /><div><br /></div><div>Growing up I applied this to a lot of things. It helps make you appear to learn faster than everyone else, and sound way smarter than you actually are.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Precision was never really something that interested me. If I could get close enough faster than anyone else, that was good enough. It worked for a while.</div><div><br /></div><div>What I didn't realize is that my ability to estimate was diminishing my ability to be precise and follow a plan of action to a specific result.</div><div><br /></div><div>To this day I can't divide two numbers on paper. I do it all in my head - and if the scope is reasonable, it works great. Until the scope is unreasonable.</div><div><br /></div><div>I can't estimate what my life is going to be like in 10 years. I can hardly estimate what my life will be like after one year. This lack of specificity has made it so not only can I not follow a life plan, I can't create one either.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm 'good' at budgeting our expenses because I can estimate quick numbers in my head, but I don't have a specific plan to actually get a desired result. I just hope it works out based on what I estimated.</div><div><br /></div><div>This attitude/default tendency in my life needs to not be used so much. It's keeping me from reaching specific results that I want to achieve. I come up with a goal and then I just hope it happens.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>My life needs to be intentional and specific. Not a product of hoping things work out like I thought they would.</div><div><br /></div><div>This concept may be simple for some people, and that's fine. But it is nearly impossible for me. I am always easy on myself, I'm always prone to make the rules bend in my favor.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Specific planning needs to be a default tendency of mine. I need to be intentional about my actions and decisions. I also need to be intentional about my priorities. It's crucial for me to stop guessing about my future.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's time I acknowledged that even because I can get close, that's not the real thing. Close to a great life is not a great life. Close to creating my own wealth is not creating my own wealth. Close to working hard is not working hard.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I need to figure out how to plan, and be able to follow a plan to the T.</div><div><br /></div><div>This feels good.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
