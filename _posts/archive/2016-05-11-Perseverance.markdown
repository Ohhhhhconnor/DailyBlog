description: When the going gets tough, the tough get going

What you're trying to accomplish isn't easy and it takes a perseverance
mentality to complete it.

Often times, because I typically am a chronic procrastinator, if I ever attempt
to begin working on a project early, I stop working on it because I don't see
the point of doing it early. My will to persevere quickly decays and I am left
wanting to do anything other than that project.

I understand now that the power of working on something a little bit at a time,
over time, is much greater than doing it all at once. But sometimes I lose that
understanding and I forget why I am doing what I am doing.

That's why this blog helps me. It allows me to remind myself daily that I am
working on becoming greater, and that's not just going to happen over night. It
must be everyday, continuing even when things get tough.

When I try to do too many changes at once, I get discouraged. That's also why
trying to accomplish projects over time is a much better plan. Rather than
becoming a new person over night, I can make small changes on a daily or weekly
basis that will allow me to continue growing and completing my goals.

That's a mentality that, over 30 years, can produce a harvest that is far
greater than anything I could imagine.
