<h3>A Whole Week</h3><h3>I don't remember the last time that happened</h3><div><br /></div><div>I'm pretty happy with myself for sticking this out for a whole week already. Its nothing major, but it points out that I can actually accomplish something that I set out to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>All of this last week's blog posts have been a brain dump to get my priorities straight. They have been mostly critical and focused on a negative aspect of my life.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I don't want things to always be like that. I am not always going to have the same problems over and over again. I am going to continue to grow.</div><div><br /></div><div>I think the goal for this blog is to use it as a platform for acknowledging the things I need to work on, creating a written path as to how I will change that thing, making note about the process and then sharing my success after I feel like I have successfully changed that thing.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also would like to use this blog as a platform to inspire and help other people that want to get their lives in order. I want other people to want to live their life as their best self, not someone who doesn't aspire to their dreams.</div><div><br /></div><div>I want to live intentionally. I don't want to just let life happen to me. I think that is clear.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm going to read some books and do some research on things that can help me do that. I know I will need my wife's help as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Right now I am reading EntreLeadership by Dave Ramsey because I think that I would one day like to own my own company and work for myself.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I would like to get the book: Living Forward by Michael Hyatt, which talks about living intentionally.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As always, I will post my progress here.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This feels good.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
