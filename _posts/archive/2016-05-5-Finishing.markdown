description: I've got to finish what I've started so I can move on to what I want to start
---

Lately, I have really been prying into this web development thing. I still am a beginner,
but I am quickly learning the ropes and applying myself in a few different ways.

I want to reverse engineer where I would like to be a half year from now. A few
months from now, *I would like to be freelance web developing at least 10 hours a week,
at around $300 to $500 a week.* That's not a crazy successful goal, but it's a goal that
I can work towards. It's about the money, but it's more about doing what I like to do.

To get there, would mean that I would have something to offer to people/businesses.
I need to be competent in design standards, as well as conversion best practices. I
need to be flexible and creative in design, but also slimming and minimalistic so the
project can actually finish on time. I also need to be quick, meaning my workflow needs
to be in place long before I start. I also need to be versed in types of sites,
e-commerce for small businesses, media for churches, etc.

Before all of that, I need to have a portfolio that shows off all of the things I can
do. I would need to have some projects lined up that I can work on for free so I can
get some practice. I actually do have a few lined up - I will be working on finishing the
e-commerce site for my brother's coffee business, potentially (I haven't asked yet) working
on a non-profit website for my mother-in-law, and also potentially working on another church
website.

Before I get to those, I have some learning that I need to complete. I am still working
on the Udemy course I purchased that has been really helpful in learning the basics of
web development and web app design. I will need to read and study some fundamental
design standards and put them into practice as well. I plan on being active on CodePen.

So that's where I am now. I am in the learning phase. I will never really leave the
learning phase, but at some point I will feel confident and move on to the application
stage, and then once I have built a portfolio and "themes" I can move on to hiring
clients that I will do work for.

This is all for a season. Who knows, maybe I will get into full time web development.
I doubt I would continue doing that, though. I need to build something that is bigger than
myself. I need to be working on something that impacts way more people than I
could ever do on my own.
