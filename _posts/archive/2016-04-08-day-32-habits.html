<br />I've been in a great habit of getting up on time. It has helped me be more productive about moving towards owning my own business, and furthering my skills in web development. <br /><br />I think I could stand to do more planning about what will specifically get done every morning. Sometimes I get up and whatever I start working on I just end up spending all of my time on it even if it isn't a high priority task.<br /><br />This would help me get a better sense of when I will get things done, as well as how long it will take me to get it done. I think that's an awesome trait to have for an entrepreneur.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>Once I finish the Udemy course, I am going to begin working on building a new podcasting service. It will allow podcasters to host their content for free, and have ads managed by my software. It will allow the entry costs to be zero, and they can spend their time doing the things they like to do.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'd like to run that for at least a year and see if I can gain traction. If I can gain enough traction and make enough money to make a profit, I could even begin investing in the business and hire employees.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>That's all a dream, but it's entirely possible. I was thinking today about how I will need to learn how the ad industry works, as well as how I will manage all of the hosting I will need for the podcasts.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am tending towards having more good habits than bad. One bad habit I have had lately is my eating. It has sucked. I need to change that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
