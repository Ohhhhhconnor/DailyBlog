I search the internet a lot for ways that I can start freelancing my web development. Most people say not to do it because it is hard.<br /><br />I'm not afraid of hard at all. I am chasing success, and I have goals that I am setting for myself.<br /><br />Yesterday I was thinking about how I could charge people for my time, and I was wondering if there was a way that I could accelerate my time by automating tasks. Turns out, you can, and it's awesome!<br /><br />Enter Yeoman (with grunt/gulp and bower). The scaffolding and package manager combination makes it an amazing tool for automating my workflow.<br /><br />I plan on using it to&nbsp; convert this blog over to a jekyll blog, and I plan on making my own bootstrap generators so that I can have my own themes.<br /><br />This will also help me get a better feel for design and the time it takes to make a website from scratch for a client. Plus, I will have designs ready and automated with colors to show clients.<br /><br />When I first stumbled upon things like yeoman and gulp and npm and the like, I didn't really understand them because I wasn't coming at it from a perspective of&nbsp; automating my workflow.<br /><br />I'm excited to keep learning and improving so that I can begin to supplement my income in the way that I want. <br /><br />Jordan
