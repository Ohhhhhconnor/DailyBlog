One month of blogging everyday. That's pretty cool!<br /><br />It has been a pretty cool journey for me. Blogging consistently has helped me start facing my dreams and get moving. It has motivated me to follow written goals. <br /><br />I think now that we're at one month, it's a good time to check in on my goals for this year (6 months?). Here they are again: <br /><br /><b>Career</b>: I will increase my work rate by limiting distractions from social media / entertainment starting now. I also will build relationships with co-workers by taking scheduled breaks at 10:30 AM and 2:30 PM.<br /><br /><b>Financial</b>: I will make at least $1000 a month on top of my salary building tools via web/app development by November 2016 (6 months).<br /><br /><b>Spiritual</b>: I am going to read my Bible/meditate/pray for at least 30 minutes a day starting now into eternity.<br /><br /><b>Physical</b>: Run a half marathon on September 18th, 2016 at a pace of 8:30 min/mile. I have this planned out via MapMyRun.<br /><br /><b>Intellectual</b>: I will learn the skills I need to complete my financial goal. I will do this by taking online classes, reading books and finding internet solutions. I will dedicate at least 30 minutes a day to this task starting now. <br /><br /><b>Family</b>: I will practice giving undivided attention to my wife everyday starting now. I also will do the same for my kids when I have them. (Is this really a goal? I might need to come up with something better.)<br /><br /><b>Social</b>: I will research time management by reading books and doing research so that I can schedule regular time to enjoy with my friends (and extended family). I would like to spend at least an hour at the beginning of the week on this task. <br /><br />This is a great list, and I think I have done well with them. I've struggled with the career goal, I've been inconsistent with the physical goal, and my social goal could always use improvement. I'm crushing my financial, intellectual, spiritual and family goals. <br /><br />So, how do I improve on the goals that I am falling behind on? I think that comes down to accountability and discipline. I could stand to have my ENTIRE day planned out the day before. That way I can't have any lazy excuses when something doesn't get done.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I still don't know if I like working out in the afternoon. I think that if I were to workout in the mornings it would get done more consistently. In the afternoons I never know how I will be feeling after a day at work, and there is often something going on right after work so the time isn't consistent.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I were to work out in the mornings, I think I would do it between 6:45 and 7:15 AM. I think a half hour is plenty for now, and I don't need to start getting ready for work until 7:30. That puts my morning routine like this:</div><div><br /></div><div>5:00 - 5:30 Wake up, make coffee, sit at desk and dive into Bible study along with praying.</div><div>5:30 - 6:45 Business/Educational hour.</div><div>6:45 - 7:15 Work out.&nbsp;</div><div>7:15 - 8:00 Shower and get ready for work, and eat breakfast.<br /><br /></div><div><div class="graf--p" name="ef93">That’s a solid morning, and it doesn’t change much of what I am currently doing. This will help improve my physical routine.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Live intentionally. Plan your future. Work harder than anyone you know.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
