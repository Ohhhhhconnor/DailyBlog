I ran a little bit too hard today.<br /><br />Today I was working on my half marathon goal. I found out the block that I live on has an almost perfect 2 mile loop. It makes things perfect for calculating pace and distance without bringing up Google maps.<br /><br />Yesterday I ran 2 miles at a 9:30 min/mile pace. Today, even though I was pretty sore from yesterday, decided to up my pace to a 9:00 min/mile pace for two miles. My quads are killing me.<br /><br />It's a good thing though, as long as I don't overdo it. The last thing I need to do is injure myself and not achieve my goal. I've gotta crawl before I walk, and walk before I run.<br /><br />A 9:00 pace is almost overkill if I just want to get under two hours. I think that's a reasonable goal to have. I'd rather be over prepared than under prepared.<br /><br />We have plenty of time until September though. I'm not too worried at all about making the progress we need to get the time we want.<br /><br />It's late. Short post tonight.<br /><br />Jordan
