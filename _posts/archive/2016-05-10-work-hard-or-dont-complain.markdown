I'm not usually one to complain about anything. I take hits as they come and
deal with it. But, up until two months ago, I was complaining about where I was
at regarding my progress in life.

You see, it's easy to blame other people for the things that go wrong in your
life. It's easy to shift the focus off of you and direct it to things that no
one can change. In reality, you are the one thing you have complete control
over. Stop complaining about how every thing affects you and instead,
start affecting your own life.

We all have choices to make, day in and day out. We make choices about our time,
our priorities, our struggles (either consciously or subconsciously). When you
think about those choices and you actually apply some thought to the direction
of your life, things begin to change.

Success and happiness are about maximizing the things that are important to
you, and minimizing the things that you don't want in your life. It's that
simple. I want to spend more time with my family - maximize that. I want to
spend less time watching TV and scrolling through social media - minimize that.

Life is about doing the best with what you are given. Shame on us if we don't
capitalize on the major opportunities that we as Americans have been given. We
live in the most free country on the planet, and with the internet, have 1000X
more chances to be successful than the generations before us.

Don't complain unless you have changed yourself first. Become the hardest
working person you know. Become the most loving person you know. Become the
best person for the job. If you're not striving for that, then you can't
complain when someone else does better than you.

I decided to make radical changes in my life, for a bunch of different reasons.
And now, I'm not complaining, I'm working; working on becoming the hardest
working person I know, becoming the best husband/father I know, and becoming the
most successful person I know.

I can only imagine how much I will get done if I continue at this pace. Every
day I get more and more done. I now understand that consistent daily habits
and pieces of work every day goes a lot farther than last minute sprints.
Procrastination and last minute was the old me, the new me just gets to work and
makes time to grow everyday.

I hope this resonates for someone, and helps them get out of a rut.
