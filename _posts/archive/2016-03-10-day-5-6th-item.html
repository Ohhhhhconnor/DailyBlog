<h2>Another Thing</h2><h2>Perhaps the most important thing</h2><div><br /></div><div>On Day 2: TIMU I listed out the things that I would like to accomplish. Then, in Day 3, I talked about some ways to try and tackle those things.</div><div><br /></div><div>Yesterday I was my <i>old </i>default self. Except my main issue was something I hadn't discussed yet. I have no concept of time management.</div><div><br /></div><div>I am way too obsessive about the thing that I am working on currently. I think this is both really good and potentially really bad. I am passionate about my work and I am somewhat of a perfectionist of the things that I have control over.</div><div><br /></div><div>This passion causes me to have big goals and dreams. It causes me to work harder and put my nose to the grinder every day.</div><div><br /></div><div>This passion causes me to neglect other aspects of my life. It causes me to ignore my priorities and render them useless.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This fundamental issue has inhibited my ability to manage some of the things that I want to accomplish. It makes me stay up late working on something when I need to go to bed. It makes me neglect other things long enough to the point that there are issues. It makes me skip meals when I need nutrition to complete my workouts.</div><div><br /></div><div>My time management always needs to be in check with my priorities. If I haven't consulted them first, then I have no grounds for dedicating time to it.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I might do some research on time management and how to make sure they are in line with my priorities. It is important that this aspect of my life gets under control.</div><div><br /></div><h2>Yet another thing</h2><div>I am going to do a fast next week from internet related entertainment, and food as well. This will put my workouts on hold, but I think it is a good thing to do for a complete reset of my priorities.</div><div><br /></div><div>I already got rid of the apps that take up most of my time on my phone, but I still need to get in the right mindset about the changes I am making.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So that will be next week, days 8 - 14. It is meant to be a physical, mental and spiritual reset on myself. I want to make sure I am in the right place before I set out to accomplish these things for this year.</div><div><br /></div><div>This feels good.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
