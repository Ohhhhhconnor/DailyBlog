I am a chronic procrastinator.<br /><br />I watched an amazing TED talk about procrastination today. You can watch it <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator#">here</a>.<br /><br />He talks a lot about why procrastinators are the way they are, but it was his point at the end of the video that struck me the most.<br /><br />You see, procrastination isn't so bad when there is a deadline. I would wait until the last minute to write a lab report or study for a test. It always worked out okay.<br /><br />The big problem for procrastinators is when they want to get something done that has no deadline. There is no sense of urgency or panic that kicks in.<br /><br />That's why it is so important for me to learn how to plan. If I can't plan for things that have no deadline, then I will never even start them.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.pixteller.com/pdata/t/l-152561.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://www.pixteller.com/pdata/t/l-152561.jpg" height="320" width="174" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-size: medium;">It's simple but it gets fuzzy for me sometimes</div><div><br /></div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I have had some success with working out for my marathon because I have both a deadline and a plan that I am using. It makes my part easy - just do what it says.&nbsp;</div><br /><span id="goog_2029835309"></span>Things like supplementing my income, building relationships, reading more and doing better at work have no deadline and no plan. How do I even remotely expect to succeed without a written plan?<br /><br />I need dates, I need steps and then I need to take action. As long as I have the other things in place, I don't think that it is too hard for me to take action.<br /><br />I will be developing specific plans in the future. These plans will need to be tested and adjusted, but they will help me get over the hump of never achieving what I want to because I procrastinate so long.<br /><br />I need to be the one to initiate and start planning these activities. No one is going to do them for me, and no one is going to care if I don't succeed, because I will still be just average default Jordan.<br /><br />In the next coming days expect written plans. If I don't deliver, someone please hold me accountable.<br /><br />Jordan.
