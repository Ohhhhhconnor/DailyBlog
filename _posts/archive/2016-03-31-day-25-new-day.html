Yesterday was awesome at work.<br /><br />I got stuff done, plain and simple. I think the main motivation was a podcast that was recommended to me by my pastor at church. The specific podcast episode is linked <a href="http://pca.st/VeBY">here</a>.<br /><br />It motivated me because it talked about having a spirit of faith, and how success is tied to it. It talked about how walking with God isn't free, and that it isn't easy. I've gotta put in the work to expect a result.<br /><br />It helped yesterday as well that I was finally able to work on a project that was on hold. I think getting that project under my belt will be great and I can move on from it.<br /><br />I purchased a Udemy web development course and it's awesome. I already know quite a bit about HTML and CSS so those sections are flying by. It's a great course that will allow me to do some neat things.<br /><br />I want to build a web server at work that connects to remote SQL Server databases and plots the data using ChartJS. As long as I can connect remotely to the PCs, then I should be able to do it easily.<br /><br />I think by doing this in my spare time I can show the people above me at work more of what i can do, and what I can contribute to the workplace. I also would like to develop a better internal homepage.<br /><br />I also want to build a church member tracking tool for church. They are using one right now that isn't that complicated and they pay $10 a month for the service. I could do the same thing and make it free.<br /><br />I also could make it better and sell it just like they do. I could add more advanced features and integrate a lot more things into the web app.<br /><br />I'm feeling really motivated. It's great to be working in a direction that is more inline with what I want out of life. Things are good right now.<br /><br />Jordan
