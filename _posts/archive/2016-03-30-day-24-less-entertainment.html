I can't be focused at work when I am jumping on YouTube or any social media every 30 minutes.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div>I'm not sure why I got into the habit of watching YouTube at work. I think it was a combination of a lack of interaction with people, and having my cube be moved to a place that has less people that work with me.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It's killing my productivity and my motivation to be proactive at work. The only time I get anything done is the day that it's due.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Most of the things I have to do lately aren't that difficult or time consuming, so I procrastinate until the last minute to get it done.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also have a hard time talking to people about progress outside of meetings. Something will come up in a meeting and I sometimes get a hint of 'why didn't you tell me that earlier?'.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>These things are making work miserable for me. It makes me not want to go in to work. Just kinda sucks.</div><div><br /></div><div>All of this is in my control, therefore I can change all of it. I have touted about moving my cube back to where I used to be, but I don't know if that is entirely necessary.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I should be able to thrive wherever I am. I should be able to be accountable wherever I am. I should be able to be productive wherever I am. It's just that simple.</div><div><br /></div><div>I can't have excuses about my situation when my path is entirely in my control. Regardless of the progress I make outside of work, I still have to show up at work. I should make the most of it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I really need to set up a meeting with my engineering manager. It's been too long.</div><div><br /></div><div>I will be proactive about it and do it today.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
