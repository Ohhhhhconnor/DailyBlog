<h3>Reiterate My Focus</h3><h2>Keep it simple.</h2><br />In my first post, I made the statement that "My default self needs to wake up every morning and create, not wake up and consume." I need to revisit this. <br /><br />Consuming content is almost like a disease. It's the opposite of making an impact on the world - rather, it is making an impact on you. <br /><br />The content we consume was originally created by someone who took the time and energy to create it. Whether it be art, social posts, information, news, etc., someone made it. <br /><br />My simplistic goal is to create more, do more and be more. The same thing could be said in this way: My simplistic goal is to consume less, relax less and be less comfortable with who I am. <br /><br />I really think that I don't need to consume any content. No social media, no tech videos, no vloggers, no news articles. It's just not necessary at the rate we are accustomed to.<br /><br />My focus is to eventually become the content that people are consuming. My focus is to make an impact on the world, not just let it make an impact on me.<br /><br />This simple switch will easily give me more time, more energy and more focus on the things that I want to achieve. How can it not?<br /><br />I'm ready for a big switch in my daily routine, and I think this is a big step.<br /><br />I'm not banning all content from my life, I'm just going to change the flow direction from <i>consume </i>to <i>create</i>. Part of changing that flow might be stopping the flow all together initially. A reset.<br /><br />I'm at a unique place in my life where I am sill able to mold my future. There are a lot of things set in stone, but that just helps me focus even more because I don't have to think about accomplishing those things.<br /><br />I want to mold my future into one of productivity, creativity and enjoyment. A future that I can plan in advance, while being bold enough to have absolutely no idea what will happen next.<br /><br />Work harder. Do more.<br /><br />This feels good.<br /><br />Jordan
