I have a lot of ideas. I'm not sure where they come from, but I write them down anyways.<br /><br />Most of my ideas are pretty terrible. I haven't thought them through all of the way before I start thinking about how I could implement them.<br /><br />But some of my ideas, they are really good. I get really excited about them, and I only wish that I could turn them into something real.<br /><br />That's why I am working so hard to learn the necessary tools to have the ability to bring my ideas to life. I can't afford to have someone else do it for me, and often times the best way to get something done, and down well, is to do it yourself.<br /><br />I'm not a genius, I'm not a mad scientist, I just work hard and learn fast. I can go from zero to semi-pro in about anything I learn in no time. That's part of why I have so much confidence in my ability to tackle my huge ideas.<br /><br />I also have ideas for other people, whether or not they like it. It's not that I know best for them, but I like to think about what I would do with the tools that they have been given and the opportunities they have.<br /><br />I like my ideas, they keep me moving forward. But, my ideas are crap if I can't act on them. If I cant put action to my words then they are worthless. That's a constant struggle that I always have to overcome.<br /><br />That's why I strive so hard to learn and grow. It's the only way I know how to push my ideas beyond the realm of just being ideas.<br /><br />I don't always plan on being the one that does the work. That's a method that can only grow as much as I can. I also need to be good about delegating my work once I have the resources.<br /><br />I'm acting on one of my ideas right now and I am loving it. It gives me even more of a reason to get up early in the morning.<br /><br />I can't wait to get to the point where I will have a product with customers that will allow me to grow my idea into a scaling business that will be able to make a difference in the world.<br /><br />Jordan
