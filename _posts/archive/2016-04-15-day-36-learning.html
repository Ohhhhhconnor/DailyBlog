I’ll never stop learning, and I won’t ever stop seeking knowledge.

There will come a point, though, when I will use my knowledge more than
I seek it. I can’t wait to see where I will be when that day comes.

Right now, learning the tools I need to start the platform that I want
to start, I feel so enabled. I feel like I could create anything that I
ever wanted to create.

My platform won’t be easy, but it’s totally doable. I get more confident
everyday that I will be able to complete the base platform on my own
before seeking out investments/employees/customers.

Both Hannah and I are in a learning state. She is learning about the
tools and methods she should use to approach her path that she wants to
take. It’s awesome to see.

My biggest problem right now is that I need to continue working hard in
every are of my life, and not just in the learning that I need to
further my dreams.

I need to make sure I am exercising hard, praying/reading/fasting hard,
eating healthy, growing my relationship with Hannah, and working hard at
my current employment.

I haven’t been exercising lately, and I’m not really sure why. I’d
really like to fast and lose a few pounds while I’m at it. I never
successfully completed the fast the last time I tried it but I know I
want to.

I could afford to lose about 20 pounds. I would like to lose the fat,
but gain muscle in return.

Here’s a wild idea that I’d like to try: I’d like to go vegetarian and
take protein supplements to increase my muscle mass. Would that be
healthy? I’d have to do some research on it. But that would allow me to
keep the fat off and increase my muscle gains.

That’s be crazy, but I do really want to be healthy and make it a focus
of mine to increase my strength.

No matter what, I’ll keep learning and growing and shifting my
focuses.
