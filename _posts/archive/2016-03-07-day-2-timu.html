<h3>Today I Messed Up</h3><h3></h3><h4>Normally it is TIFU but let's keep it PG</h4><div><br /></div><div>Something that I have repeated several times with my wife is telling her what my plans are, rather than asking her if my plans fall in line with her thoughts. It's not enough to just plan ahead. I need to ask her if it's alright. We are a team. It's not what I think is necessary but this is simple. Get in the habit of doing that.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>By not doing this, I managed to mess up having dinner with my wife, going on a walk with my wife and I was late to the thing that I planned on doing without asking her if it was okay. It was a mess.</div><div></div><div></div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hpXfmyA-OK4/Vt5MhPD5CWI/AAAAAAAAD3E/RBDEziyBCcM/s1600/12819047_1005110202894743_1782752212_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hpXfmyA-OK4/Vt5MhPD5CWI/AAAAAAAAD3E/RBDEziyBCcM/s320/12819047_1005110202894743_1782752212_n.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Us smiling (look at her cool hair!)</td></tr></tbody></table><div><br /></div><div>In this post I want to establish some of my goals for this upcoming year.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>As you know, I want to blog everyday for a year. But there are a few other things that I would like to improve/plan.</div><div><br /></div><div><ol><li>I'm gonna run a half marathon on September 18th. That means I need to get fit.</li><li>I want to supplement my engineering income with freelance web development. My goal is to be making at least $1000 a month on top of my salary. That means that I really need to learn Javascript properly, and also do something more than work off of a bootstrap template.</li><li>I'm going to read more. I would like to read both the Bible and another book everyday for at least 15 minutes each. That means I actually need to open a book everyday.</li><li>I want to exponentially increase my work rate at my employment. That means that I will need to get better organized about how I spend my time and also I need to develop better relationships with my coworkers.</li><li>I want to continue to deepen my relationship with my wife, family, and friends. That means I need to at least pick up my phone once in a while to make a call and not just consume content.</li></ol><div><br /></div></div><div>That means I need to get fit.

That's a little more difficult, and something that Hannah is really good at. I will be soliciting her help.</div><div><br /></div><div>This feels good.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div><div><br /></div>
