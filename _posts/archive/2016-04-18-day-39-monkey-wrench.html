When Google get's involved, it's probably time to get out of that market.<br /><br />Google has come out with a new front end interface for podcasts built into it's Google Play Music app. That's not good for my idea.<br /><br />That means, Google has bought in to the way Podcasts are operated the way they are now. It means they didn't think it was necessary to revolutionize the whole market. Why should I?<br /><br />I still think it would be really valuable to build the web application that I want to build. I need to build a portfolio for myself. But as a business? It might be a losing battle. I might not be looking far enough into the future.<br /><br />The way Podcasts are run are yesterday's technologies. They are only becoming more popular today because of the accessibility people have to larger data caps and faster cellular networks.<br /><br />There are other things that are the future. Things like IoT, VR, AI. The best thing I could do for a business would involve one, if not all, of these technologies. That would create a platform that is revolutionary and future proof.<br /><br />The nice thing about learning the web development tools, is that it's free and I can implement whatever I want if I take the time to do it. You can't do that with hardware based ideas.<br /><br />All of this learning is still so valuable. Working hard won't always bring success, but success won't come without me working hard.<br /><br />Things are good. I need to figure out how to make some more money quick, but things are good.<br /><br />Jordan
