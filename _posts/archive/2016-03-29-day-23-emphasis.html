I put a lot of emphasis on my progress outside of work, and that's okay. But it's not okay if I'm not doing well at work.<br /><br />I spend a lot of time thinking about how I will make more money outside of work, how to improve myself outside of work, and my work has suffered because of it.<br /><br />I'm still stuck in my current situation - somewhat isolated from my old group of engineers. I really want to get back to working with them and get out of the current group I am working in. <br /><br />I also haven't been looking into how I can make more money at work. Honestly, I know that if I was the hardest worker in the building, they probably would pay me more. I could ask for a raise at a moment's notice. <br /><br />Is that how I should be approaching this? Should I continue to invest in ways to make more money outside of work, when there is a potential that I could be killing it right where I am at?<br /><br />I had these questions yesterday when I was sitting at my desk. I mean, a consistent job truly is a great thing. It's up to me to make the most of it. I really should be emphasizing my focus on it since my job is the reason I can put food on the table everyday.<br /><br />My biggest problem is, I hate how much time it is going to take me to pay off my debt and save for a home and start a business. We're talking like 10 years minimum. That's a long time!<br /><br />I feel like I can't settle into a routine unless I am making headway towards accelerating my debt payoff. I feel like it's something that I need to do.<br /><br />I'm pretty sick of making a good salary, yet living paycheck to paycheck. There has to be some ways that I can make more for my family so that we can get this debt paid off sooner rather than later. <br /><br />Doing something other than what comes naturally to you is really hard. This whole freelancing thing isn't natural to me. Engineering is natural to me. <br /><br />I think I will talk to my engineering manager about all of this. He seems to be very understanding. I don't bug him much, but maybe I should. I'd like to get his input about how i can make some changes at work.<br /><br />I'm not a bad worker, but I'm in a bad spot. Something isn't jiving with me. I need to be moving forward both at work and outside of work.<br /><br />Keep moving forward.<br /><br />Jordan<br /><br />
