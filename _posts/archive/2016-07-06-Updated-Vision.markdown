description: Some things have changed, others have not.

I still need consistency in all areas of my life. That vision will never change.
I need consistency in my relationship with my Wife, my family, spirituality,
exercise, eating, sleeping, working, etc. But these things need to work together
to push towards a common vision. Something that allows me to keep growing daily.

There is one thing that annoys me a lot. My entire life, there has been a guy
who is also named Jordan O'Connor that has been able to dominate the search
for that name. He's a Canadian music artist that hasn't put out an album in more
than a decade, yet he still reigns the search. That is going to change. I am
going to dominate that search. I will be the most popular and successful Jordan
O'Connor in the world.

I plan on doing this my web development firm [thrown][link1]. I plan on using the
alias "@thrown" for all of my online projects and things that will bring
attention to the brand. I'm super excited about this and I can't wait to see
what things will be like in the future.

Even though I am kicking off my business, I am still in a learning phase. I need
to be a JavaScript guru. I need to be able to be a one-stop solution for all of
my customers. I need to be able to make Jekyll sing. I need to have design
standards that I can live by that will make my workflow quicker and more
efficient.

My fitness goals are all but trashed. I was supposed to be fit by now. I think I
have been approaching it the wrong way by wanting to do a marathon. Really, it's
not about running. It's not even about being fit (though that's awesome). It's
about discipline. Same with lifting weights, eating healthy, loving my wife,
being there for my family.

> The mere fact that I want to do these things doesn't make me a better person if
I don't have the discipline to go out and do them consistently without wavering.

By approaching this from a consistency and discipline perspective, it doesn't
matter how I do these things, but rather that I actually show up and do them.
I need to be able to rely on this consistency to get me through anything that I
decide to tackle in life. I need it to make sure I am always loving my wife,
always staying fit, always being my best self no matter what.

This consistency and discipline approach is something that can rub off on others
as well. I can make an influence on other people by being able to truly embody
the person that I want to be. As long as I am the person that I want to be, then
I can do anything that I set my mind to doing.

I should be in better control of all of the aspects of my life that I can reach.
I should be making sure that we have our meals planned out and I should be
helping prepare them so that we can eat healthy and feel good about ourselves. I
should be planning out my time in the mornings so that I spend adequate time on
exercise, spirituality and my work. I should be allowing specific time for
myself to grow and learn alongside the work that I am doing.

There is a lot of accountability, communication and planning that needs to go
into getting these things done daily. I've talked about all of this before, and
I have tried to plan things out, but it's about time I actually started doing
them.

## Getting There

Communication and planning are two things that I have struggled with a lot in
the past. They have kept me from reaching my true potential, from being the
person that I want to be.

I want to be the person that can take on any challenge, yet remain steady in all
of the things that I am doing in life. I can't just be good at one thing and
think that all of the other things will fall into place. Everything takes
practice. Everything takes work. Everything needs time.

I love reviewing my daily timeline - so let's do that. Here is what I currently
have:

* 4AM: Web Dev
* 6AM: Bible / Prayer Time
* 6:30AM: Work out
* 7:15AM: Get ready for work
* 7:45AM: Blog post
* 8:30AM: - 5PM: Work
* 5:30PM: Make dinner/Have dinner/Hang with family
* 9:30PM: Get Ready for next day / Bed
* 9:45PM: In bed / Write plan for next day
* 10PM: Sleep

The problem with this is that I think I have to work out and get ready before
anything. It's imperative that I am wide awake and ready to go when I begin
working. Also, I need to establish a "screens off" time for the evening with
Hannah. This would be just during the week, but I think that 9:30 PM timeframe
is a good cutoff point.

I think that I should be making my lunch the night before. This would allow me
to squeeze even more time out of my morning. Breakfast should also be made
before I start working, not after.

Let's remake that timeline:

#### New Timeline
* 4AM: Wake up to Work Out
* 5AM: Shower/Get Ready
* 5:30AM: Make Breakfast
* 5:45AM: Bible Time
* 6AM: Work Time
* 8AM: Leave
* 8:30AM: Day Job
* 12PM: Call clients
* 1PM: Day Job
* 5PM: Head Home
* 5:30PM: Make dinner/Have dinner/Hang with family
* 9:30PM: Make Lunch / Screen Off
* 9:45PM: In bed / Write Plan for Next Morning
* 10PM: Sleep

This timeline will work well. I always say that, but I want to stick to this
one. I have tried several things and I think this one comes from experience.

The worst thing I can do for myself is not plan accordingly the day before.
