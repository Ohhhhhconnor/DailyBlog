I find it interesting when I look at the motivations that I have behind
wanting to start my own business. In the short term, I want to be out of
debt. I want to be able to support my family and begin building
wealth.

But I think this drive goes much deeper than that. It more fits my
personality, something that is flexible but stable, something that I
created myself. Something I can strive for and push towards everyday.

In my mind, I’d like to be able to work wherever I am in the world. I
don’t want to take vacations, but rather trips that still allow me to be
productive. Sitting on a beach gets old for me really quick.

To me, trips are more about experiences than relaxation. I can relax
just fine at home. I want to travel for the sake of having unforgettable
experiences and see things I never would have seen had I been
relaxing.

But I also want that flexibility in my everyday life. I want to be able
to exercise, see my kids and talk with my wife in the mornings. I want
to live close to work, so that I can make sure the commute isn’t an
excuse for not seeing them often.

I want to work hard, though, and that will require some late nights for
seasons and it will require a lot of my attention. That’s part of the
reason why I need to waste none of my extra time. I need to spend any
extra time on the things that are most important to me.

I don’t want ‘work’ to define me, but I want to be defined as a hard
worker. I want to be the hardest working person I know. Both at work,
and in the home. I want my kids to see that they need to work hard to
achieve their dreams. Not only that, I want to teach them that it’s a
good thing to have dreams and that they should feel like anything is
possible.

I want to teach them to learn for themselves, to love other people and
build meaningful relationships. I want to teach them that they have
control over the path that their life takes, and that it’s not dependent
on anything in their past.

I want to have the flexibility to play that role in my kid’s lives.
