Let's attempt to break down that financial/intellectual goal.<br /><br />After much, much deliberation, I have decided that I like to build tools. I like being able to enable people to accomplish the things that they want to do in a better and more appealing way. <br /><br />That's why I like where I work. I get to build and develop test bench hardware/software so that operators can use them to measure and verify product. I like to make the experience for the operator one that allows them to not even notice that it is there. <br /><br />I want to get into web development. It's the future (and right now). I want to be able to build tools for other people that are useful and well polished. I come up with ideas all of the time, but I need to sit down one day and actually implement them.<br /><br />I don't like dealing directly with people, so that's why contracting/consulting web development just isn't up my alley. It's easiest to get started in, but it would get old fast.<br /><br />I don't think I want to do web development for another company. I think I would get the feeling of being stuck and carrying out someone else's vision. I'd rather start my own company surrounding my own tool that is a part of my vision for myself. <br /><br />One big potential market is writing software for church management. There are only a few players, and that sector could use some fresh talent. It's useful for me too because I am currently going to a startup church, and they could use some management software.<br /><br />Other than that, the thing that I would have the most experience in is development in IoT tools, Data acquisition and management tools, and sensor I/O tools. I think an ideal platform for me to develop on would be something like a Raspberry PI, or a BeagleBone. <br /><br />These are just some ideas, but I need to act quickly. I want to be making $1000 a month in just 6 months. Time is ticking away. <br /><br /><div>I think that I should spend a solid 2 months developing my craft. I would like to learn an online platform (AngularJS/React/Ruby On Rails), and app development for IoT purposes. This is also the time that I would need to come up with an idea for an application.</div><div><br /></div><div>I think then I would like to spend about a month developing an application that I would hope to build a small business around.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, I would like to spend the last three months setting up my business and getting my first customers.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This could all change dramatically, I am just trying to play it all out. I need to get it all written down somewhere so I have somewhere to come back to.</div><div><br /></div><div>I want to start my own company. It's been a dream of mine for a long time. Even if I fail this time, I will learn a lot and I can apply it to my future endeavors.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
