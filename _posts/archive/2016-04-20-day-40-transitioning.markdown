I think it has been hard trying to transition from my corporate job to an entrepreneurial position. My passion isn’t into my corporate job, and my work has suffered for it.

I’ve never been one to keep a good conversation or just ‘pop in’ at work. I’m hesitant to talk about anything but work with my boss. I’m not exactly sure why, but that’s how it is.

Some people I can talk to really easy. It’s usually when they start talking to me though, not when I start talking to them.

My passion isn’t in my engineering work anymore. I see how the people have worked for the company for years and years, and I feel like they have a lot of regrets. They have done the same thing for so many years, never leaving the position they are in.

Some people like that. That feeling of stability and security. Me, on the other hand, I prefer being on the cutting edge and creating my own path. I don’t want to start a company for the money, I want to start one because I want to have control over my future.

I want my success to be a direct result of the effort that I put into it. I don’t want to feel like I am capped or that I can’t grow at the scale that I would like to.
At work, I feel trapped in my position. There is very little growth, yet lots of expectation. They say that they reward thinking outside of the box and individual creativity, but I’ve never heard of anyone who has climbed that ladder in this company.

If that ladder was available, surely I would climb it, and quickly. I would feel so much better about staying at the company if I actually had the tools and could choose the path that I see as necessary for the company.

There are a few things my company needs. In engineering, there is no way to track data, store it, and view it in an interactive way. I would love to develop a dashboard for that. Also, the process of transferring product from beginning to end is archaic and needs an overhaul similar to the data.

If they would let me work on these things, I might just want to stay. I feel that it’s right up my creativity alley, and I would really enjoy doing it.

I am somewhat tired of the weird, one-off I/O applications that I have to write at work. I’d rather build something that everyone could use and everyone could interact with.

Web technologies are the future. It’s inevitable. That’s the only thing that connects all of the things we use every day. If the company won’t let me progress them to that point, then I won’t keep working there.

The other bad thing is, I can only work 40 hours and never get any overtime. When I need more money, this sucks. Working part-time on something else sucks, because the $/hour rate is way lower than my corporate work rate.

Also, Corning is a great company. Part of my beef is with the division I am in. It lags behind all of the other industries that Corning operates in, so that sucks. I want
