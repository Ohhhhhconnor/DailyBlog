I've been listening to Gary V lately, he says you can't be an entrepreneur if you have a full time job.<br /><br />I think he's right. Though, he was caught off guard by the question. He had just realized that some people have to have some way to transition out of a normal paying job into the one they want.<br /><br />His basic statement was that you have the potential to be an entrepreneur if you feel choked out by working for someone. He also is adamant about making sure you don't listen to what anyone else says you can't do.<br /><br />When I was in college, I had a friend who had started his own business. He had made an app. It never sold more than a few times, but it was cool and I admired him for the effort he put in.<br /><br />I told him once that I would one day like to start a company. He responded by saying it was a ton of work and not really worth the effort. This moment stayed with me for several years.<br /><br />Back then I didn't listen to the right people. I didn't think for myself. I was green, very new to the idea of being in the real world.<br /><br />Entrepreneurship isn't easy. Successful entrepreneurs make it look easy, but it's not. There is a lot that has to go right for and entrepreneur to be successful.<br /><br />Right now, I can't be an entrepreneur. I'm working a full time job. It's a default by definition.<br /><br />But, one day, I will be an entrepreneur. It's what I crave. I still have that wide-eyed sense that I had back in the day when I was told that I shouldn't start my own business.<br /><br />I feel like I am suffocating working at a corporate job. It's so stagnate. So normal. So average. I want to be way more than average, I want to be my best me.<br /><br />I want to take life by the horns and show the world what I can do. I feel like I have so much more to offer than what I am currently doing. I am just getting started.<br /><br />My plan right now is to not be an entrepreneur. Why? Because I have bills to pay, mouth(s) to feed, debt to pay off. I plan on freelancing extra income to get my debt paid off so I can live a life with minimal expenses and put all of my time towards creating a business.<br /><br />Without my debt, my family could easily live on less than $2000 a month. That's less than half of what I make now. Imagine if I was able to use that extra income and put it to work for me rather than just using it to pay for my past debts.<br /><br />With debt, I need a high paying job to get by. Without it, I have freedom to choose where I want to spend my time and energy and I can really have a grasp on what the future holds for me.<br /><br />I have a spirit of faith that says that I can be successful, I can be wealthy, and I can love what I do. I will show everyone that I have the spirit of faith by saving money, paying off debt and creating my own path.<br /><br />It's only a matter of time. I am serious about this.<br /><br />Jordan
