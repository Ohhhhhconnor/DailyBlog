I've been writing all of this stuff down in my blog, but I have't been writing it down where I can see it everyday.<br /><br />I should be writing my goals down somewhere where I will be able to review them and check against them every day. Something like the background of my phone, or on the new tab of my web browser.<br /><br />I should also be using Todoist to break down my goals into smaller chunks. It's good for putting in dependency tasks and flexible with the timeline.<br /><br />I also should be planning my morning hours more specifically the day/night before. I should know exactly what I am going to work on and how long I'm going to work on it.<br /><br />I still am unsure about the time-frame of my morning hours. I think in an ideal world I would like to work out in the mornings, but I also don't want to spend time away from Hannah in the evenings doing work. I want to be investing time into our relationship when she is available.<br /><br />I am getting up at 5 everyday this week. That means I basically have 2 hours to work before I have to go to work. 1 hour should be Bible time, the other should be work/studying time for my freelance writing and web development.<br /><br />I like to start paragraphs with 'I'. Maybe because I am talking about myself?<br /><br />I think eventually I would like to turn this blogging habit into a lifestyle blog. Something that motivates people to follow their dreams, gets them out of their comfort zones and makes them think.<br /><br />It would be awesome to have a following of people that I could use to make waves in this world. Once you have followers, you can use that momentum to become successful in a lot of areas.<br /><br />We got a new desk last night. Something functional, minimalist and that inspires productivity. I think it will help me get more organized about how I spend my time when I am doing work at home.<br /><br />Hannah will be using the desk as well. She will be using it to start her online business, or to put time into her non-profit that she dreams about everyday. One day we will both have desks that we can operate from.<br /><br />She has a passion for helping people, and she has a passion surrounding taboo and controversial issues that aren't being talked about the right way. Things like how pornography affects the world, and tackling the root causes of why people think they want abortions.<br /><br />She's a dreamer, and I can only hope that any company I would found can have as much empathy and passion that she does about what it is trying to achieve.<br /><br />I think I will be organizing the next day right before bed. It will allow me to be a bit more dynamic based on the time I go to bed. I think specifying not only how much time I will spend on things, but exactly what I will be working on will be very helpful.<br /><br />Getting organized is something I don't think I am a natural at. I tend to not plan ahead and just take things as they come. In the past this worked fine because opportunities would come left and right and I could adapt quickly.<br /><br />Now, I am the one that needs to create the opportunities for myself. So if I am not planning and organizing my path, then there will be no opportunities for growth and prosperity down the pipeline.<br /><br />This was a good blog post.<br /><br />Jordan
