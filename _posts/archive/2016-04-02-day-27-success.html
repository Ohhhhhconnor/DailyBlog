What's my definition of success? I think there are a few things.<br /><br />I think first and foremost my definition of success is having the option to work how I want to work and not be forced into a work situation because I need a paycheck.<br /><br />I also think success is being able to provide for my family in a way that contributes to their success and keeps them healthy. I want them to feel like they can live a purposeful life of their choosing without feeling like money is a prohibiting factor.<br /><br />I also think that success is being able to have deep relationships with the people that I love without work getting in the way. I want to be able to enjoy the time I have with others, and be able to invest in their lives in a meaningful way.<br /><br />That sounds like a dream job. Something that pays well, allows for flexibility and doesn't get in the way of things that mean a lot to me.<br /><br />I think it would be hard to find a job like that without creating it yourself. Everything would have to be on my terms, but it would also have to be valuable enough to bode a decent income.<br /><br />Once I am out of debt and have less restrictions on where my income is spent I can have freedoms like this. Until then, I need to be the hardest working person I know, hustling at every chance.<br /><br />Jordan
