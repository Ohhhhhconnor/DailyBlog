The key to not being a miserable failure is to be ready before you need to be.<br /><br />I was supposed to start fasting today. It was going well, at first. I made it past lunch and even into the evening. It was then that I realized that I was in over my head.<br /><br />The last time I had fasted was back in college. I had several advantages then. I was more healthy, had less responsibilities and I had a friend to do it with.<br /><br />Today I am fatter than I want to be, I have an 8 - 5 job that people depend on me to get done, and I am doing it alone. It's much different from my last scenario.<br /><br />So, I gave in and had dinner tonight. I felt bad, but my brain thanked me. One of the major points of fasting is prayer and reading, and I was doing the reading but not the praying.<br /><br />I think this was a big reason why I had success before. I was good at 'praying without ceasing'. It was natural for me. Lately, it's not even on my mind.<br /><br />I think I had it backwards when I thought that fasting would put me in a place of somewhat redemption. In reality, in order to have a successful fast, my heart and mind need to be in the right place.<br /><br />That makes my priority list all the more important. I should have my priorities in place before I need them.<br /><br />I heard on the EntreLeadership podcast by Dave Ramsey today, "The easiest time to build relationships is before you need them." That was a really eye opening quote for me.<br /><br />Building relationships has always been hard for me. But I'm finding out that relationships are everything and are the only thing worth anything in this life outside of hard work.<br /><br />I think the best route for me is a period of transition that will allow me to become the person that I want to be. I would like to be able to fast purposefully every month in the future. But I can't do that if I am not ready.<br /><br />That also leads me to another point, which is one of faith. Part of the reason fasting is implemented is because of how hard it is, and how you have to give up on your own strength and depend on God's.<br /><br />That's where a strong prayer link comes in. If I'm not praying, then fasting is going to be a miserable, fleshly failure.<br /><br />The key to not being a miserable failure is to be ready before you need to be.<br /><br />This feels good.<br /><br />Jordan
