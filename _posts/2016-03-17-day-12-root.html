What caused me to set the goals that I have set?<br /><div><br /></div><div>That's a good question, considering that if I couldn't answer it, my priorities would be unfounded.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have a lot of debt. About $150k. It makes you feel stuck. It stunts your growth. I need to accelerate my payments and get it out of my life. That's why I would like to supplement my income.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm getting older, and getting weaker. I also am aware of the positive links between being fit and how healthy your brain is. That's why I would like to get fit.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have not been living my life intentionally with my current relationships. I constantly am wishing I would do more with my friends and family that matters. And really, they are the ones in my life who matter. That's why I'd like to deepen those relationships.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have been slacking at work. I talked a little bit about why in my last post, but that's really no excuse. It's not who I want to be. That's why I'd like to work harder at work.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have not been reading enough. Faith comes by hearing and hearing comes by the Word of God. By not reading my Bible, I am not contributing to my faith, and therefore I cannot expect all that God has promised will take place in my lifetime. Knowledge is power, and by reading I can acquire knowledge. That's why I would like to read more.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have hardly any control over where my time is being spent. My priorities are out of whack, and I waste days away like nobody's business. That really needs to end. That's why I'd like to get better at time management.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's pretty easy for me to point out the reasons behind the things that I want to achieve in the near future, and I think that is a good thing.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Saying something and doing it are two completely different things. I want to be a man of my word, and do what I say I will do.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I want to look back at my life and have as few regrets as possible. I want to reap what I have sown and see the fruit of my labor. I want to be the hardest working person I know, all while being the most invested in his relationships.</div><div><br /></div><div>It's going to take a while for me to get there, but I will. You have my word.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
