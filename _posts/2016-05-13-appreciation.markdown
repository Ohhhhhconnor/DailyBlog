It's easy to take things for granted when you live in the richest country in the
world. It's in our culture to have the best of everything and expect nothing
less.

I think it's a healthy thing to want more, to expect more. I don't want to stay
in the same place my entire life. I want to grown and have things grow around
me. But, That's no excuse to neglect or forget the most important things in my
life. I can't get caught up in the dream if there is no balance.

Every important area of my life deserves the same amount of appreciation,
tenacity, and hustle that I put towards my ventures. I can't use all of my
energy and attention in one place, it needs to be spread across all of the
things that are important to me. Things like my wife, family, my health, my
spirituality, my friendships and social interactions. They all matter, and they
all come together to form a great life if you don't allow them to go to the
wayside.

It would be tragic for me to lose one of those things just because I want to
grow in a business/monetary sense. Imagining if I let my relationship with
Hannah go astray, or my friends or co-workers or my health. All of those things
would be terrible. And for what? So I could try to grow faster myself?

There is a definite balance that needs to be struck during this growing period.
It is pertinent that I pay close attention to all areas of my life. It's not
enough to focus on only the things that will make me grow. That's selfishness
at its core.
