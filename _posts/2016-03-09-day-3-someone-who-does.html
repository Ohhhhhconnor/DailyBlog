<h3>I almost forgot to do this tonight.</h3><h2>It's late.</h2><div><br /></div><div>My last post talked about the things that I plan on doing. This one will talk about some plans to achieve those things.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I have a few things planned out, and a few things I am still working on.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Exercise is planned out. I got an app called 'Run Trainer' and it scheduled my workout for every day up to the half marathon.</div><div><br /></div><div>I have a few plans for learning Javascript and getting deeper into web development. Starting out I will be following a plan designed by 'Javascript Is Sexy'.</div><div><br /></div><div>The other things I haven't planned yet and will need a bit more diligence to accomplish.</div><div><br /></div><div>Developing deeper relationships, reading more and doing better at work all come with priority. If I don't set them at a high enough priority, they won't get done.</div><div><br /></div><div>That means other things need to get knocked down on the list. Things like, obsessively checking instagram/reddit/google plus/meduim/feedly/facebook/youtube. I read them way too much. I'll be deleting most of those off of my phone shortly.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are other inhibitors that aren't necessarily priorities so much as they are habits. Things like staying in my comfort zone, defaulting to laziness and distraction, and not taking time to think about my priorities and what I should actually be doing with my time.</div><div><br /></div><div>Priorities are always something I have said is the key to my success, but have never really gotten them in order. I'm a big hypocrite like that.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Doing is much harder than talking. I'd like to be known as a doer, not a talker. Someone who does what means most to him. Someone who actually does what he says he will do. Someone who always does the right thing. Someone who does.</div><div><br /></div><div>But how do you become someone who does? How do you break your own mold, when it was you who created the mold in the first place? Is not the mold I created truly my character?</div><div><br /></div><div>I can be so much better. I can do so much better. I can do so much more.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Work harder. Do more.</div><div><br /></div><div>This feels good.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
