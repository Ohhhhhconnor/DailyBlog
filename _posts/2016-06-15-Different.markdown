description: There are a few things I need to do differently.
---

I have been doing really well in some areas but not others. I have been coding
quite a bit, working on my business and trying to get clients, but spiritually,
physically, and financially I have been lacking.

I need these things to drive me to a lifestyle that I want for myself. These
are things I want people to know about me. I want people to know that I am
a spiritual man with a faithful heart and pure motives. I want people to know
that I am physically fit and maintain my physical body well both through
exercise and healthy eating. I want people to know that I have money and I am
being a good steward of that money, so that I can be an example.

But if someone were to ask me about these things today, I wouldn't have much to
say. I would have to admit that I am not exactly working on them as often as I
would like, and I have a somewhat imbalanced lifestyle right now.

I can't be imbalanced when the baby comes. If I am, I will be a mess. I will
feel like I can't get everything done that I want to, and I will get frustrated
about not moving as fast as I think I should.

Don't get me wrong, when the baby comes everything will be different and I will
put so much energy and focus into my family. But, I need to keep hustling. It is
my duty to my family to be successful and accept nothing less. I need to be the
one who will provide at levels that are true to my full potential.

I also need to write some new content. I have been doing this daily blog thing
for a while, but I need to be writing about my experiences and the things that
I learn on a day-to-day basis. I learn a lot, and if I don't capture that, I
will lose it. I'll probably start a technical blog at some point. It will be
at [this URL][link1] when it's ready.

I need to document my journey to becoming a pioneer in web development. I need
to capture my route to contributing to open source projects and communities. And
who knows, maybe I will be able to start my own open source community.
