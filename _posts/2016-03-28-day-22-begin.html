Discipline is easy when you don't have any other choice.<br /><br />The easiest way for me to be more disciplined is when I set rules that force me to be more productive when I need to be productive. <br /><br />After talking it over with Hannah, I have set explicit rules stating that I will be reading for an hour, and working on my freelance business for an hour each morning before work. The evenings are off limits for business ventures.<br /><br />Since the evenings are off limits, and she is on board with that, I can't break that rule. It would detract from the seriousness of my move towards being more disciplined and productive. <br /><br />The evenings will be filled with running, dinner and Hannah time. Or, anything else we have planned that evening. I will be going to sleep between 10 and 10:30, and waking up at 5:30 every day. <br /><div><br /></div><div>That gives me 2 hours before needing to get ready to go for work. Reading my Bible and praying will be first, since it is most important. Business comes after.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also have dedicated some of my lunch time at work for studying and working on business ventures. I don't know how much I like that, since there are a lot of things that usually eat into my lunch time, but at least I will know what to do if there is nothing going on at lunch.</div><div><br /></div><div>Time management and planning are crucial tools that I will need to learn for my freelance business. Having a work schedule spelled out so there are no 'blurring of the lines' and the rules are clean cut will help me be more productive and responsible about billing my time accurately.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So, today I am beginning that disciplined schedule. I woke up at 5:30 and began studying. Now I am transitioning over to my business work time. It feels good, and it is great to feel like I'm not taking any time away from time that I could be spending with Hannah.</div><div><br /></div><div>Also, my food eating habits have been atrocious lately. I need to knock that off and get healthier. I think I will try to have a minimal meat and no sugar diet. It's just so terrible for me and my health. I have a little bit of a pot belly and that needs to go away.</div><div><br /></div><div>I also wanted to try to take at least 5 minutes every morning and do push-ups and sit-ups. Maybe in the future I will add on to that so I am doing strength conditioning every morning.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
