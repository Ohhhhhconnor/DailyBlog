I want to get my web design business started and off the ground. That's a scary thought for me, considering I have learned all I know within the past two years or so, and I didn't go to school for it.

  
It's scary because I feel like I don't have the credentials. When I got my corporate job, I almost felt entitled to a position because of how qualified I was. Now, it's intimidating calling a client because they might ask for something I don't know how to do.

  
Successful people commit first and figure it out later. That's part of the 10x Rules. 

  
It's also intimidating having my success ride on the fact that I need to be able to be diligent to get my work done as soon as I can, and acting as fast as I can. I need to be calling up clients, communicating, working, learning all the time. 

  
I'm normally one to put things off. That's what I am trying to change about me. If I am going to be a self-starter, I have to be able to do the work I need to do before I actually need it done. 

  
This includes the things I don't always want to do, and the things that aren't glamorous about having a small business. Things like cold-calling clients, following up on things, and certain financial pieces.

  
I don't really have a choice, though. No one is going to make me successful other than myself. No one is going to do the work for me. 

  
I know what work needs to be done. It needs to be prioritized, planned and attacked. I need set times and steps to get me moving in the right direction. 

  
My next big step is cold-calling/emailing small businesses in the area. Well, as soon as I finish my re-branding as a web design company only. 

  
My go-to workflow will be a static Jekyll site with CloudCannon CMS and Snipcart e-commerce if needed. All of these are on the cutting edge and are modern. They represent what I want to give to my customers. 

  
I should be practicing this workflow, though. I should know the Jekyll documentation forwards and backwards. I should know exactly how CloudCannon will respond when I do a specific configuration. 

  
One thing I'll need to do is pick a UI framework. I typically go with Skeleton, but there is always the option of Bootstrap. I think that Skeleton really falls in line with what I am trying to achieve. Besides, the lighter my setup the more I can customize it.

  
I've noticed that I really like getting to work first thing in the morning. It comes naturally to me. I think my planned schedule will look like this from now on: 

  
* 4AM: Web Dev
* 6AM: Bible / Prayer Time
* 6:30AM: Work out
* 7:15AM: Get ready for work
* 7:45AM: Blog post
* 8:30AM: - 5PM: Work
* 5:30PM: Make dinner/Have dinner/Hang with family
* 9:30PM: Get Ready for next day / Bed 
* 9:45PM: In bed / Write plan for next day
* 10PM: Sleep

  
It's tough to squeeze the blog post in there. Normally it takes me longer than 15 minutes to write. I'll need to stat planning topics so I can move faster and think faster. 

  
This is good, I'm constantly trying to adjust so I can be productive. I really want to be able to achieve the things that I want to do. I want to be successful, and It's on me to make sure that happens.
