Mostly because I had it all planned out.<br /><br />That's how I want everyday to be in the future. I want it to be planned out, calculated, so that I don't waste the time that I have. I don't want to be extremely rigid, but I want it to be planned. <br /><br />This can apply to the workplace as well. I would like to make sure I have a set number of things that I should complete during the work day. <br /><br />I did some math today, and I figured out that if I reached my goal of an extra $1000 a month, I could get out of debt in five years. Five years! That would be incredible. Even more motivation to get this done. <br /><br />Our cars would be payed off within the next year. Credit cards in a few months. It would be amazing to be operating at that level.<br /><br />I like to write, and I don't mind writing creatively. I have found that there are sites what will pay you to write freelance for them. I found a site called Listverse that will pay you $100 per article, with 10 facts and at least 1500 words. <br /><br />I could write several articles a week for that publication and not even bat an eye at it. There would be no learning curve, it would just flow out of me. I think I might start looking into all of my options as a freelance writer.<br /><br />In the meantime, I will continue to learn and grow in the web development sphere. I have to keep moving along in the Udemy class that I purchased. I also need to find other things to apply my new-found skills to so that I can start building a portfolio.<br /><br />One idea that I had today - a podcast service that was like youtube. It's not a new idea, but I'm surprised it doesn't exist. There is no service out there that allows you to host podcasts for free, all while managing the ad sphere for you. <br /><br />Today was a good day, I'll be getting up early to keep working.<br /><br />I'm going to be the hardest working person I know. <br /><br />Jordan
