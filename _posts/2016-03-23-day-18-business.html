<br /><br />I really want to start a business. <br /><br />I'm good at making things talk to each other. I'm good at integrating software and hardware. I want to start an internet of things company for industrial businesses. <br /><br />Right now, manufacturing software sucks. I see it first hand every day. I get paid because I can do it, but doing it results in some of the most ugly and non-intelligent programming on earth. Why does everyone have their own standard for communicating?<br /><br />I love the concept of Google's Brillo and Weave ventures. It makes so much sense. Let's put all of the devices that talk to each other on the same platform so they can interact with each other in the most optimal way. <br /><br />I really wish I was on the teams developing that product, but I am not. But, I can start a business selling advanced and modern industrial IoT devices to manufacturers with the intent of eventually supporting the open and secure infrastructure that Google is fronting. <br /><br />I think I would like to start by tackling the data acquisition market. The only reason I think that is because I have a ton of exposure to it, and national instruments holds a monopoly. They do a good job, but I could do it better. LabView is an industry standard. It does amazing things, but it is hideous and is almost impossible to scale. It's spaghetti code, and most of the people that use it can't wield its true power.<br /><br />I want to create an elegant solution that is robust enough for the industrial environment, but has the aesthetic edge of the modern web/app design architecture. I want to have a solution that works out of the box, something that has extensive simplicity and compatibility. I want to make a solution that allows developers to create powerful applications without needing to worry about scale and their user interface. <br /><br />Since this is an IIoT company, all solutions will be accessible to anyone who has access/is interested and the data should be configured in a way that is accessible and can be viewed in ways that brings the most value to the end user. I want data to be accessible on any platform. Mobile, desktop, tablet, and web. <br /><br />To me this sounds amazing, and it solves problems that real engineers struggle with every day. It sounds like the future, and it could help minimize the cost of developing complex applications for industries that need to use these tools to measure and verify products.<br /><br />This isn't my only idea. But it is the one that resonates with me the most. It's something I have dealt with over the past 3 years and I think I can do it better than the tools that I use currently. <br /><br />Honestly I am just excited to get started on something that solves real problems. I like to build tools. Tools that help other people achieve really cool things. That's what I want to do.<br /><br />Jordan
