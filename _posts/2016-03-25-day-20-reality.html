I don't think I can start my business today. Or any time soon for that matter.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I need to make more money by hustling at the moment. I need to pay off my debt and be done with it. Since I want to cash-flow my business, I want to be debt free before I start.</div><div><br /></div><div>That means my business will probably be in something different than the last blog post. It will be similar, but in the time that passes someone else will fill that market, I guarantee it.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Starting a business wasn't on my list of goals, making more money is. I guess I should make sure I reference my list often.</div><div><br /></div><div>There are three ways I can make more money. Freelancing, developing and teaching. I can freelance web-development, develop my own apps and sell them, or teach courses on how to make apps/develop in different languages.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Freelance is a lot of work. I would need Hannah's help to organize clients and manage. Developing my own apps would require a stroke of luck to actually make a decent amount on them, so I don't think I will be doing that, and teaching is definitely on the table.</div><div><br /></div><div>Creating online courses is the cheapest way to make the most profit. I would need to invest time in learning things that are both relevant and useful. I use LabWindows at work everyday, but that's not something most people need.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I think I would like to potentially do both freelancing and creating online courses. I've never done either, but it would be a cool adventure. I think that I could be a neat thing to track my progress and build a path that others could follow to make extra money on the side.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>It would also be neat to have people that I could send emails to about how to make money on the side. It only takes 1000 people to have a platform for success. When you have that many people listening, you've made it.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'll start looking into proper freelancing, learning tools to do that, and also I will pick a specific path that I would start teaching.</div><div><br /></div><div>Jordan</div>
